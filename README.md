This crates offers two types, `ManuallyDrop<T>`, and `MaybeDangling<T>`, which do not carry
[aliasing/`dereferenceable`-ity properties](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3336) w.r.t. the
`T` they each contain, which means they are allowed to:
 1. have some expired value inside of them, such as `T = &'expired â€¦`,
 1. be fed to a function that does not inspect its value (such as `::core::mem::forget()`),
 1. exhibit well-defined behavior (no UB!).
